## State if the following statements about goodness functions are true or false.

Goodness functions take measurements as input
TRUE

Measurements can only be numerical
FALSE

Standar mathematical optimization requires the existence of goodness functions to be optimized, and the definition of these functions is usually feasible in the real world.
FALSE

Machine learning requires the definition of a goodness function to be optimized.
FALSE

Machine learning techniques can build good models only if abundant data is available
TRUE



##Kriging is a technique originally built to identify the best map coordinates to dig gold mines. State if the following statements about Kriging are true or false

The goodness function to be optimized is Gold(x), the quantity of gold extracted from a mine at position x.
TRUE

The measurements are the gold quantities extracted in different points.
FALSE

Kriging is an example of descriptive analytics.
FALSE

The model of the goodness function, built using measurements aims at generalizing the results obtained during the experiments.
TRUE

The output fo the model of an unknown point is the average of the known values of its neighbors, weighted by the neighbors' distance to the unknown point.
TRUE


## State if the following statements about structured and unstructured data are true or false.

Images are an example of structured data.
FALSE

Text is an example of unstructured data.
TRUE

Vectors are an example of structured data.
TRUE

Comma Separated Values (CSV) files are an example of structured data.
TRUE


## State if the following statements about the different types of analytics are true or false

Predictiove analytics goes further than descriptive and prescriptive analytics.
FALSE

Descriptive analytics involves the analysis of historical data order to provide useful insights.
TRUE

Predictive analytics tries to anticipate the effects of decisions, by creating models based on historical data.
TRUE

Presciptive analytics uses optimization and simulation algorithms to consider the effect of many possible decisions, in order to take the decision that it is expected to optimize a certain goodness function.
TRUE
