State if the following statements about goodness functions are true or false.
Goodness functions take measurements as input
TRUE

Measurements can only be numerical
FALSE

Standar mathematical optimization requires the existence of goodness functions to be optimized, and the definition of these functions is usually feasible in the real world.
FALSE

Machine learning requires the definition of a goodness function to be optimized.
FALSE

Machine learning techniques can build good models only if abundant data is available
TRUE

Kriging is a technique originally built to identify the best map coordinates to dig gold mines.
State if the following statements about Kriging are true or false

The goodness function to be optimized is Gold(x), the quantity of gold extracted from a mine at position x.
TRUE

The measurements are the gold quantities extracted in different points.
FALSE

Kriging is an example of descriptive analytics.
FALSE

The model of the goodness function, built using measurements aims at generalizing the results obtained during the experiments.
TRUE
