#Given the two spirals dataset CSV file, create a 2-dimensional scatter plot of the spirals, 
#using a different color for each spiral. 
#Then apply the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to all the elements of the dataset 
#using k  âˆˆ  {3, 5, 10} and compute precision, accuracy and recall.
#
#TIPS:
#
#consider spiral 1 as the positive class
#when evaluating, do not include the point you are predicting in the neighbors (this would be cheating)
